                <p>The word 'lorem', for example, isn't a real Latin word,
                    it's a shortened version of the word 'dolorem', meaning pain.
                    This makes the current dummy text impossible to translate into English.</p>

                <p>In publishing and graphic design,lorem ipsum is a filler text commonly used to demonstrate
                    the graphic elements of a document or visual presentation.
                    Replacing meaningful content that could be distracting with placeholder text may allow
                    viewers to focus on graphic aspects such as font, typography, and page layout.</p>

                <p>It is widely believed that the history of Lorem Ipsum originates with Cicero in the 1st Century
                    BC and his text De Finibus bonorum et malorum.
                    This philosophical work, also known as On the Ends of Good and Evil,
                    was split into five books.</p>
